# An enhanced Instagram UI written in React Native

## Introduction

I used [Juxtopposed's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtffucAmM78&t=1s&pp=ygUVaW5zdGFncmFtIHVpIHJlZGVzaWdu) video as a design reference. You can explore the Figma file [by this link](https://www.figma.com/file/oDouuSqsLQMFs5cwTdHQeX/Instagram-Redesign-(Community)?type=design&node-id=14-1839&mode=design&t=kidetlNawUdtbraz-0).
